					<h2>The Road to CSS Enlightenment</h2>
					<p class="lead">
						Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
						browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS
						support, and abandoned browsers.
					</p>
					<p>
						We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment
						has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk
						like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.
					</p>
					<p>
						The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on
						the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with
						clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new
						and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="about-section">
					<h2>So What is This About?</h2>
					<p>
						There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The
						Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
						participation. To begin, view some of the existing
						designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the
						style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the
						same, the only thing that has changed is the external
						CSS file.
					</p>
					<p>
						CSS allows complete and total control over the style of
						a hypertext document. The only way this can be
						illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
						demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are
						placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from
						structure.
					</p>

					<div class="feature-grid">

								Careful attention to readable, accessible, and
								beautiful text presentation.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-card">
							<h3>Color Theory</h3>

						<div class="feature-card">

					<h2>Participation</h2>
					<p>
						Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are
						modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary
						too, but the example files show that even CSS novices
						can participate if they keep their ambitions modest.
						Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials
						and tips on working with CSS.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						"The beauty of CSS design is that it separates content
						from presentation, allowing for endless creativity while
						maintaining semantic meaning."
